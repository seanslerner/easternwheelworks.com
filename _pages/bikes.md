    title: "Sunday Bikes"
    excerpt: "Sunday launched in the spring of 2005. Their primary goal from the beginning was to create products that addressed the reliability problems that riders have faced since the 1980’s. Back in ’05 ordinary frames were still struggling with the same-old “weight verses strength” issues that had limited riders for over two decades. Either a bike was “strong”, but heavy as a boat anchor, or a bike was “light”, but only lasted for a month or two. They were tired of dealing with all of this and always felt that BMX deserved better. In response, Sunday was born."
